 abstract = {We study temporal step size control of explicit Runge-Kutta methods for compressible computational fluid dynamics (CFD), including the Navier-Stokes equations and hyperbolic systems of conservation laws such as the Euler equations. We demonstrate that error-based approaches are convenient in a wide range of applications and compare them to more classical step size control based on a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number. Our numerical examples show that error-based step size control is easy to use, robust, and efficient, e.g., for (initial) transient periods, complex geometries, nonlinear shock capturing approaches, and schemes that use nonlinear entropy projections. We demonstrate these properties for problems ranging from well-understood academic test cases to industrially relevant large-scale computations with two disjoint code bases, the open source Julia packages Trixi.jl with OrdinaryDiffEq.jl and the C/Fortran code SSDC based on PETSc.},
