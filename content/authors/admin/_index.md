I am an interim professor (Vertretungsprofessor) for Computational Mathematics and
research software engineer at the
[Applied and Computational Mathematics Research Lab](https://www.acom.rwth-aachen.de)
at
[RWTH Aachen University, Germany](https://www.rwth-aachen.de).
For this position, I am currently on leave from heading the
[Training & Scalable Algorithms group](https://www.hlrs.de/about/tasc)
at the
[High-Performance Computing Center Stuttgart (HLRS)](https://www.hlrs.de).
My research focus is on numerical methods for adaptive multi-physics
simulations, research software engineering for high-performance computing, and
scientific machine learning.
