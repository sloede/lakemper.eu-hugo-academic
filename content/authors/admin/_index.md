I am computational scientist and professor at the
[Centre for Advanced Analytics and Predictive Sciences ](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/en/forschung/einrichtungen/institute/caaps/)
of the
[University of Augsburg, Germany](https://www.uni-augsburg.de), where I lead the
[High-Performance Scientific Computing Lab](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/fakultaet/mntf/math/prof/hpsc)
in the Faculty of Mathematics, Natural Sciences, and Materials Engineering.
My research focus is on numerical methods for adaptive multi-physics
simulations, research software engineering for high-performance computing, and
scientific machine learning.
