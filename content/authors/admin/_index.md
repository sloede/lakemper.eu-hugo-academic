I am a group leader and research software engineer at the
[High-Performance Computing Center Stuttgart](https://www.hlrs.de)
of the
[University of Stuttgart, Germany](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de).
My research focus is on numerical methods for adaptive multi-physics
simulations, high-performance computing with Julia, and scientific machine
learning.
