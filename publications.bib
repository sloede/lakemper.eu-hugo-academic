  abstract  = {Hybrid computational fluid dynamics (CFD) - computational aeroacoustics (CAA) schemes are the standard method for aeroacoustics simulations. In this approach, it is necessary to exchange information between the CFD and the CAA step, which is usually accomplished by storing acoustic source data. This data exchange procedure, however, poses two problems when such hybrid methods are used for large-scale problems with O(10^9) degrees of freedom: Firstly, the required disk space becomes large and reaches hundreds of terabytes for a single simulation. Added to that, the parallel scalability of the overall numerical scheme is limited by the available I/O bandwidth, which typically peaks between 5,000 and 10,000 cores. To avoid these problems, a highly scalable direct-hybrid scheme is presented, in which both the flow and the acoustics simulations run simultaneously. That is, all data between the two solvers is transferred in-memory, avoiding the restrictions of the I/O subsystem. Both solvers operate on a joint hierarchical Cartesian grid, which enables efficient parallelization and dynamic load balancing, and which inherently supports local mesh refinement. To demonstrate the capabilities of the new scheme, the aeroacoustic field of a co-rotating vortex pair is computed and the flow-induced noise emissions of a turbulent, isothermal jet are predicted. The results show that the direct-hybrid method is able to accurately capture the sound pressure field and that it is particularly suitable for efficient, highly parallel simulations. Furthermore, in comparison to the classic hybrid method with data exchange via disk I/O, the novel approach shows superior performance when scaling to thousands of cores.},

While these techniques increase the robustness of DG methods significantly, they are also computationally more demanding than standard weak form nodal DG methods. We present several implementation techniques to improve the efficiency of flux differencing DG methods that use tensor product quadrilateral or hexahedral elements, in 2D or 3D respectively. Focus is mostly given to CPUs and DG methods for the compressible Euler equations, although these techniques are generally also useful for GPU computing and other physical systems including the compressible Navier-Stokes and magnetohydrodynamics equations. We present results using two open source codes, Trixi.jl written in Julia and FLUXO written in Fortran, to demonstrate that our proposed implementation techniques are applicable to different code bases and programming languages.},

We demonstrate that error-based approaches are convenient in a wide range of applications and compare them to more classical step size control based on a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number. Our numerical examples show that error-based step size control is easy to use, robust, and efficient, e.g., for (initial) transient periods, complex geometries, nonlinear shock capturing approaches, and schemes that use nonlinear entropy projections. We demonstrate these properties for problems ranging from well-understood academic test cases to industrially relevant large-scale computations with two disjoint code bases, the open source Julia packages Trixi.jl with OrdinaryDiffEq.jl and the C/Fortran code SSDC based on PETSc.},
